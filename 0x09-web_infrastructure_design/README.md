# 0x09-web_infrastructure_design

	This project was served us by ALX as an introduction to the world of **DevOps**.
	Here we started the race by trying to understand the concept of web stack. Also, we learnt how important it is to make decisions that will improve the scalability, performance, and availability of our application.
	This really helped our understanding of how big companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook etc. scale their applications and services in order to best serve their users.

## Some concepts learnt are:

- Servers, Web servers, and Application servers. Here, we learnt that they are different entities and function differently.
- Load balancers and how they help scale up the performance, availability, and maintainance of an application. Load balancers are really powerful.
- Database... This normally exists on the server side and help store, manage and protect data that are used or required by an application.
- DNS and its record types
- Single point of failure and its disadvantage to an organization.
- How to avoid downtime when deploying new code.
- What firewalls are and what HTTPS stands for?
